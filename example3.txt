; Example 3: More complex scenario with observations
; This demonstrates the observation action feature (additional requirement)
; The agent can pay to observe distant edges before committing to a path

#V 4    ; 4 vertices forming a diamond shape

; Diamond graph:
;       2
;      / \
;     1   4 (target)
;      \ /
;       3

#E1 1 2 W2 F 0.4 ; Edge 1-2, weight 2, 40% flood chance
#E2 2 4 W2 F 0.3 ; Edge 2-4, weight 2, 30% flood chance  
#E3 1 3 W2 F 0.3 ; Edge 1-3, weight 2, 30% flood chance
#E4 3 4 W2 F 0.4 ; Edge 3-4, weight 2, 40% flood chance

#K1 1            ; Kit available at start
#EC 3            ; Expensive to equip (3 time units)
#UC 1            ; Cheap to unequip (1 time unit)
#FF 2            ; 2x slower with kit

; Observation capabilities (additional requirement)
; From vertex 1, can observe the status of edges at the far end
#O V1 E2 1       ; From V1, observe E2 status for cost 1
#O V1 E4 1       ; From V1, observe E4 status for cost 1

#Start 1
#Target 4

; Strategy analysis:
; - Without observations: agent must commit to a path without knowing if far edges are flooded
; - With observations: agent can pay 1-2 units to scout before moving
; - Expected behavior: depending on costs, agent might observe before deciding which path
