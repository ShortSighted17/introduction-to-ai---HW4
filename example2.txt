; Example 2: Simple test case
; Minimal graph with just 3 vertices and 1 uncertain edge
; Good for debugging and understanding the MDP structure

#V 3    ; 3 vertices

#E1 1 2 W2 F 0.5 ; Edge from 1 to 2, weight 2, 50% chance of flooding
#E2 2 3 W1       ; Edge from 2 to 3, weight 1, no flooding possible

; No amphibian kit available - agent must handle flooding by alternate routes
; But there's no alternate route, so this tests what happens when stuck

#Start 1
#Target 3

; Note: With 50% flood probability on E1, the agent should:
; - Try to traverse E1 (will learn its status)
; - If clear: continue to target via E2
; - If flooded: cannot proceed (stuck - no kit available)
